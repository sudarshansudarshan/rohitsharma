This is a common space for writing the code of the Peer Evaluation System.
We have pasted the GS code of pre and post-evaluation.

We discussed the blueprint for the UI/UX of the Peer Evaluation System. The attached file contains the requirements, other details, and screenshots of the sample interface with code.

9th Sep 2024: - We started studying the paper "LearnEval Peer Assessment Platform: Iterative Development Process and Evaluation", which discusses team-based evaluation systems like SPARK, SPAS, WebPA, and CATME, as well as individual peer assessment systems like Web-SPA, WFPAS, and EduPCR, to understand the scope and broad applications of the project.

3rd Oct 2024: - We formulated a Google Form and received some of the responses that included a single PDF or JPG file containing multiple signatures from students. We manually started preparing the dataset from the form data by segregating the images and labeling them. However, we are unable to use the script to do so because the signatures submitted by the students are not in the format we provided.

14th Oct 2024: - Finalized the Admin and Teacher dashboard with the required functionality. The TA dashboard is also ready but requires some input regarding which functionalities need to be kept.

16th Oct 2024: - We are testing the UI/UX and fixing any bugs found, while also adding additional features as needed.

22nd Oct 2024: - We are working on the issue of passing the number of questions from the front end to the back end, which has arisen due to changes in the registration window and other updates to the code.
