This is a common space for writing the code of the Peer Evaluation System.
We have pasted the GS code of pre and post-evaluation.

We discussed the blueprint for the UI/UX of the Peer Evaluation System. The attached file contains the requirements, other details, and screenshots of the sample interface with code.

9th Sep 2024: - We started studying the paper "LearnEval Peer Assessment Platform: Iterative Development Process and Evaluation", which discusses team-based evaluation systems like SPARK, SPAS, WebPA, and CATME, as well as individual peer assessment systems like Web-SPA, WFPAS, and EduPCR, to understand the scope and broad applications of the project.

3rd Oct 2024: - We formulated a Google Form and received some of the responses that included a single PDF or JPG file containing multiple signatures from students. We manually started preparing the dataset from the form data by segregating the images and labeling them. However, we are unable to use the script to do so because the signatures submitted by the students are not in the format we provided.
